      <h2>Revolut</h2>
      <h4>You will love this app. üòâ</h4>
      <p>The guys were annoyed by the ossified banks, which are slowly adapting to the modern smart age. They have created a nice mobile wallet with a card with which you can pay in about 180 countries around the world.</p>
      <p>Revolut will provide you a "bank" account with IBAN, a Master-Card, the opportunity to send money to people as messages, create payment links that you can send to anyone and have them pay by card ... and much more.</p>
      <div class="sp"></div>
      <p><strong>The best feature for which we use Revolut is currency conversion. Revolut does not charge anything at all for the transfer from the whatever currency to the Euro there and back.</strong> It exchanges with a universal intra-bank exchange rate, the purchase and sale price is the same. üî•</p>
      <p>Revolut is free and then offers a premium paid membership with other benefits, ... Basic membership has one condition, the minimum amount of money to top up the account is about 10 euro.</p>

      <h3>First step</h3>

      <h2>Binance</h2>
      <h4>This is not a crypto exchange, this is an ecosystem. üññ</h4>
      <p>Nowadays you can safely and calmly keep the Cryptocurrencies on <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=HYQR8TEK">www.binance.com</a>, an exchange that no one else can match. Speed, support, liquidity, the lowest fees, ... they set user comfort on all fronts, <strong>the user comes first for them!</strong></p>
      <p>Fees per trade are 0.100%, if you add a Binance coin (BNB) to your portfolio, you can further reduce the fees to 0.075% per trade. üëå</p>
      <div class="sp"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="w light" style="background: linear-gradient(0deg,rgba(0,0,0,0.8),rgba(0,0,0,0.5)), url('https://i.ibb.co/L5MxV47/stepan-prucha-blockchain-transactions.jpg'); background-size: cover;

    </div>
    <div class="p">
      <div class="sp" id="second"></div>
      <h3>Second step</h3>
      <p><strong>After registration and verification at Binance, charge the Euro, Pound or Usd. Then, exchange it for BNB, BTC or Cryptocurrency according to preference.</strong></p>
      <p>These two cryptocurrencies have the most exchange pairs and the most liquidity. This means that it will exchange the required amount for you more easily and quickly.</p>
      <div class="sp"></div>
      <p>Next, It is up to you how you proceed. If you just need to buy Bitcoin (BTC) and hold, or you would rather hold a Binance-coin (BNB) ... or exchange part of Binance-coin or Bitcoin for Cardano (ADA). More advanced users can send Cryptocurrencies to paper or hardware wallets ...</p>
      <p>Binance is really trustworthy, if you <strong> verify your account and secure it </strong>, you can stay calm and hodl Bitcoin or Cardano in your account. You can also move the funds to "<strong> Saving account </strong>", so it is gaining an interest 1-5% per annum.</p>
      <p>Thanks to verification, your relatives can access your accounts with user support if you die or something similar happens to you. üëç</p>
